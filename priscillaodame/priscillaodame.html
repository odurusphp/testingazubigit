        <p>The C.E.O, in an interview was asked for his motivation in bringing up this restaurant. This <br>
            is what he said:
        <br>
        <blockquote>
            <q>There is no food difficult for you to eat. It is just a matter of psyching yourself.<br>
                Free your mind and the food will settle in your belly because the sweetness of <br>
                the pudding is in the eating.
            </q>
        <br>
