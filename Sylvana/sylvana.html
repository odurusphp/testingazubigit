               <h2>A Message From The C.E.O</h2>
               <p>The C.E.O, in an interview was asked for his motivation in bringing up this restaurant. This<br> is what he said:</p>
               <blockquote>
                   "There is no food difficult for you to eat. It is just a matter of psyching yourself.<br>Free your mind and the food will settle in your belly because the sweetness of<br>the pudding is in the eating."
                    <br><br>
                <cite>-Honourable Nana Yaw Oduro</cite>
